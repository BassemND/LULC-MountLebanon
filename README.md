# Land Use and Land Cover Change in Mount Lebanon (2005–2022)

## 📍 Overview
This project was conducted as part of my Master's thesis in Surveying Engineering at the Lebanese International University. It analyzes land use and land cover (LULC) changes over an 18-year period in Mount Lebanon using satellite imagery and GIS tools (ArcGIS 10.3).

The study compares CORINE visual interpretation and supervised classification to track urbanization, vegetation loss, and agricultural changes.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor urban expansion and land transformation.
- Compare CORINE and supervised classification methods.
- Produce maps and statistics for planners and researchers.

## 🛠 Tools & Data
- **Software**: ArcGIS 10.3, Excel
- **Imagery**: IKONOS (2005), BASEMAP (2017), SAS (2022), LANDSAT (30m)
- **Study Area**: 13.45 km² in Mount Lebanon (Aley, Bmakine, Ain Remmaneh, etc.)

## 📊 Methodology
1. Satellite image preprocessing and band selection
2. CORINE classification (Level 4 → Level 1)
3. Supervised classification using training samples
4. Raster conversion and accuracy comparison
5. Map creation and land cover trend analysis

## 📈 Results
- Urban land increased by 2.5%
- Agricultural and forest areas slightly decreased
- Notable variation between CORINE and supervised results
